## Introduction

The [Swanky CLI Tool](https://github.com/swanky-docs/swanky-cli) is designed to take the manual effort out of scaffolding your documentation. With the __Swanky CLI Tool__ you can quickly create scaffolding [sites](/getting-started/setup-installation.html), [content](/getting-started/adding-content.html), [themes](/getting-started/theme-customisation.html) and [snippets](/getting-started/creating-snippets.html).

If you do not find what you are looking for please a look at the [troubleshooting](/troubleshooting.html) guide or raise an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/swanky-docs/swanky-cli/issues).

### Installation
Install the __swanky-cli__ tool globally on your system.
```bash
$ npm install -g swanky-cli
```

### Running the Generator
Now that you have the __Swanky CLI Tool__ installed you can easily create or add to your documentation site. Simply type `swanky` into your command prompt and the generator will guide you through the creation process. If you know what you want you can start a specific generator by typing `swanky generate [site|page|snippet|theme]`.

```bash
$ swanky [generate] [type]
```

### Help
The __Swanky CLI Tool__ has a very simple help menu.

```bash
$ swanky --help
```

### That's A Wrap
If you have followed the [Getting Started](/getting-started/setup-installation.html) guide and have made it this far, you should know enough to build any type of documentation you require. If you think we have missed something or you have a feature suggestion/improvement please drop us a line at [GitHub](https://github.com/swanky-docs/swanky-cli/issues). Peace. &#128330;
