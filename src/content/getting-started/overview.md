### What is Swanky Docs?
Swanky Docs is a framework that enables you to create beautiful documentation from any source that you can provide it with. Swanky Docs can be viewed as a type of static site generator that has been specifically focused on doing one thing well - __documentation__. Swanky Docs can be used to create API documentation, Living and Breathing __Pattern Libraries__ or maybe a combination of both. There really is no limit to what you can document with Swanky Docs.

### Why Swanky Docs Over Other Documentation Tools?
Unlike other documentation tools Swanky does not enforce a specific way of writing documentation or require you to use any custom markup. Swanky embraces how you already make your documentation e.g. *markdown files*, *comments in your code*, *documentation on github*... With the flexibility and power of Swanky Docs __processors__ you can capture any source and turn it into beautiful documentation.
